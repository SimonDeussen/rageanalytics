## How to run it

### Extension

- open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/` 
- tick the `Developer mode` and click on `Load unpacked extension`
- upload the `extension` folder from this repo

### AI-Server

The AI-Server is located in the `engine` subfolder. 
use pyhton3 to run ` engine/output_generator_flaskserver.py ` 


### Port forwarding

The extension runs in your browser on your local machine. It will connect to the port 5000. Since the Engine runs on a different machine, you have to create a port forwarding via ssh.
